# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project simply allows you to vizualise how 8 of the most popular/non-popular sorting algorithms ever created work.


## Merge Sort
#### Worst Complexity: n * log(n)
#### Average Complexity: n * log(n)

## Bubble Sort
#### Worst Complexity: n<sup>2</sup>
#### Average Complexity: n<sup>2</sup>

## Selection Sort
#### Worst Complexity: n<sup>2</sup>
#### Average Complexity: n<sup>2</sup>


## Quick Sort
#### Worst Complexity: n<sup>2</sup>
#### Average Complexity: n * log(n)


## Cocktail Shaker Sort
#### Worst Complexity: n<sup>2</sup>
#### Average Complexity: n<sup>2</sup>

## Heap Sort
#### Worst Complexity: n * log(n)
#### Average Complexity: n * log(n)

## Radix Sort
#### Worst Complexity: n * k/d
#### Average Complexity: n * k/d

## Shell Sort
#### Worst Complexity: Depends on the gap sequence
#### Average Complexity: n * log(n)<sup>2</sup> or n<sup>(3/2)</sup>
